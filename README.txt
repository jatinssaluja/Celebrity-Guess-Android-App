******************************** Celebrity Guess Android App *************************************************************



1) In this app, for the purpose of fetching images, I have used the JSON api of "celebritybucks.com", JSONObject and JSONArray. For connecting to the internet, I have used AsyncTask. 

2) In this app, the user guesses the celebrity when presented with the image of celebrity and four clickable button choices to choose from. When the user selects one of the four choices, the user is notified whether the answer is correct or wrong. At the end of 15 questions, all buttons get disabled and the user is presented with "Play Again" button to start the quiz anew.
